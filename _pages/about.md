<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a first-year CS PhD student at <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu"> Rutgers University</a> supervised by Professor <a href="https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/zz124/">Zheng(Eddy)Zhang</a>. I received my bachelor degree in the <a href="http://xxxy.lzu.edu.cn/">CS Department </a>  (by courtesy) at  Lanzhou University(since 2019) majoring in CS and I was affiliated with the <a href="http://xxxy.lzu.edu.cn/jigoushezhi/xisuoshezhi/2020/1014/139911.html"> Centers for Computer Software and Theory </a> with Prof. <a href="http://xxxy.lzu.edu.cn/ shiziduiwu/jiaoshiduiwu/jiaoshou/2020/0914/132022.html"> Yonggang Lu </a>. Before my first year in Rutgers, I was an intern in Westlake University supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/fajie-yuan.html"> Fajie Yuan</a> researching on AI + Biology.

                   Due to the fact that I'm interest-oriented, my research interests are pretty diverse and they span across Machine Learning and Ai4Science. My research aims at: 
                   <ul>
                        <li>Machine learning in graphs, both <font face="MyriadProRegular" >practically</font> and <font face="MyriadProRegular">theoretically</font>, in a principled manner to enable its applications in critical domains like community detection in graphs;</li>
                    
                        <li>Machine learning and deep learning on Science, especially for problems involving quantum computing and biological problems</li>
                   </ul>

                    •I'm a broadcaster on Tiktok!<br>
                    I have been running a Tiktok account doing contents about AOV（Arena of Valor）/王者荣耀 with 200+ followers now! As for my competence, the highest rank for the ranked match is 'Lengendary King' and the highest Peak Tournament(巅峰赛) I have once reached is 2282. At the mean time, 68-Lane Battle, 60-Lane Roaming, 58-Lane Jungle witness my ability to excel in Moba games. It's worth mentioning that I was once in compliance with professional player Wolf.Xiao Pang(狼队小胖) and national-famous broadcaster Lala (快手辣辣).
