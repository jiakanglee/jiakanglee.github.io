I am currently a first-year CS PhD student at <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu"> Rutgers University</a> supervised by Professor <a href="https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/zz124/">Zheng(Eddy)Zhang</a> working on quantum machine learning. I received my bachelor degree in the <a href="http://xxxy.lzu.edu.cn/">CS Department </a>  (by courtesy) at  Lanzhou University(since 2019) majoring in CS and I was affiliated with the <a href="http://xxxy.lzu.edu.cn/jigoushezhi/xisuoshezhi/2020/1014/139911.html"> Centers for Computer Software and Theory </a> with Prof. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yonggang-Lu"> Yonggang Lu </a>. Before my first year in Rutgers, I was an intern in Westlake University supervised by Prof. <a href="https://fajieyuan.github.io"> Fajie Yuan</a> researching on AI + Biology.

                    <h2>Research Interest</h2>
                    
                   Due to the fact that I'm interest-oriented, my research interests are pretty diverse and they span across Machine Learning and Ai4Science. My research aims at: 
                   <ul>
                        <li>Bridging the gap between Quantum Hamiltonian and Quantum circuits compilation, especially when it involves Fermionic system</li>
                        <li>Improving the Quantum circuit optimization using machine learning methods</li>
                        
                        <li>Machine learning in graphs, both <font face="MyriadProRegular" >practically</font> and <font face="MyriadProRegular">theoretically</font>, in a principled manner to enable its applications in critical domains like community detection in graphs;</li>
                   </ul>

I interned as a machine leanring algorithm intern in airline ticket department, where I helped to impove the accuracy for predicting the airline tickets prices; Also I was responsible for risk management project, I trained a machine learning model and improve its precision for capturing malicious users to 90% compared with its previous update five years ago.

                    •I'm a good gamer for MOBA GAMES<br>
                    I have been running a Tiktok account doing contents about AOV（Arena of Valor）/王者荣耀 with 200+ followers now! As for my competence, the highest rank for the ranked match is 'Lengendary King' and the highest Peak Tournament(巅峰赛) I have once reached is 2282. At the mean time, 74-Lane Battle, 60-Lane Roaming, 60-Lane Jungle witness my ability to excel in Moba games. It's worth mentioning that I was once in compliance with professional player Wolf.Xiao Pang(狼队小胖) and national-famous broadcaster Lala (快手辣辣).

                    •I love singing!<br>
                    I have received a lot of friends' compliment on singing :), but I haven't got the time yet to test out that in a campaign :( !
                    <br>
                    •I'm the FOUNDER of the <a href = "https://lzufly.github.io/"> Lanzhou University Flyer organization </a> <br>.
                    I serve as a bridge between the graduated and the undergraduate in Lanzhou University :)!<br>

                    •Personality: My MBTI is ENFJ<be>
                    I'm a very self-motivated person, in which sense I tend to accept new challenges and like to inspire people. So I'm easy to get along with. feel free to send a email to me on everything.!<be>
